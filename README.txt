This application is written by me, no other code copy-pasterino performed


Application contains 3 differnet recursive functions

Front-end is more complex than back-end

This App is tested only on windows10 and windows7, i'm not shure about cross-platform features

Code contains only few lines of commnets

A lot of JQUERY used

 + Ability to delete files/folders/Non-empty-folders that have been just added
 + Feature that allows you to create a folder, with a foldername that already exists
   (for example if we already have a folder called 'neva' and we trying to append another
	folder called neva, then 'neva(1)' folder will be appended,(2),(3)...);
